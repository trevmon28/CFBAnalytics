The goal is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variables.\n","\n","### Types of Linear Regression\n","\n","1. **Simple Linear Regression**: Involves one independent variable and one dependent variable. The relationship is modeled as a straight line.\n","   - Equation: \\( y = mx + b \\)\n","   - Where \\( y \\) is the dependent variable, \\( x \\) is the independent variable, \\( m \\) is the slope, and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept.\n","\n","2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Involves multiple independent variables. The relationship is still linear, but it accounts for more factors.\n","   - Equation: \\( y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n \\)\n","   - Where \\( b_0 \\) is the intercept, and \\( b_1, b_2, ..., b_n \\) are the coefficients for each independent variable.\n","\n","### How It Works\n","\n","1. **Data Collection**: Gather data for the dependent variable (e.g., score margin) and independent variables (e.g., team stats).\n","\n","2. **Model Training**: Use a dataset to train the model. The algorithm finds the best-fitting line by minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual values (using a method called \"least squares\").\n","\n","3. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can predict the dependent variable for new data by plugging in the values of the independent variables into the equation.\n","\n","4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or R-squared to see how well it predicts the outcome.\n","\n","Linear regression is widely used because it is simple to understand and interpret, making it a good starting point for predictive modeling."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a2e14601","metadata":{"id":"a2e14601"},"source":["## 1.

Imagine you guess the score margin for a bunch of games. MAE tells you, on average, how far off your guesses are from the real answers. Lower is better.\n","- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average of the squares of the errors, i.e., the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. Like MAE, but it punishes big mistakes more. It squares the errors before averaging, so really bad guesses count extra.\n","- **R-squared (R²):** Imagine you are trying to guess the score margin for football games. R² tells you how good your guesses are compared to just always guessing the average score margin. If R² is **1**, your model predicts perfectly. If R² is **0**, your model is no better than just guessing the average every time. If R² is **negative**, your model is worse than just guessing the average.
